--Food Customization--
When ordering a menu item, there is now a text box that appears where the customer can type in whatever information they want
for the kitchen to see during the preparation of their food. This can be from food allergies, dietary needs, or even just not
wanting to eat certain ingredients.

--Pictures--
Pictures now appear when the menu item is clicked in the menu tab of our project. Not all items currently contain pictures 
however they all have the potential to as there is an image section added to the database.

--Specials/Deals--
There are now package deals titled Combos that appear on the menu. Along with a new tab on the homepage titled Deals. When 
clicked this page will display all items that are either a combo or have a discounted price to help show customers what the 
current best deals are.

--Preorders--
Preorders are done by when ordering the food select the table -1. This table does not exist, however is used as a temporary 
table for the restaurant to keep track of the order. When the customer arrives, under the PreOrder tab the edit button can be
clicked and the table can be adjusted from -1 to the current table that the customer will be seated at. The hostess will still
need to seat the customer on the table map.

--More Food Info--
When the menu item is clicked in the menu tab it will now display any allergies the food may contain along with the amount
of calories per dish.

--Status--
There is now a tab on the main menu titled Status, what it does is show the current orders that have been made along with
show a check box of whether or not the dish has been completed. When the dish is completed in the kitchen, the edit button
will need to be selected and the box titled IsPrepared will need to be checked. This will show that the dish has finished 
being prepared.
